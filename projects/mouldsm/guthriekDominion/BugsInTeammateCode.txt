One bug report, which should be caught but isn't, at least with the test cases
submitted for the last assignment, is the number of treasures found in 
adventurer card. Both my code and his code have the same bug, which is a 
coincidence. On line 1244 in dominion.c in the playAdventurer function the 
logic allows for an off by one error resulting in one too many treasure cards 
to be put into the hand. The new test cases have adjusted for this.  An Example
is below. 

TEST 239 FAILED 6 != 5 :: (drawntreasure, 2+existing treasures), checking that # of treasures is correct
TEST 240 FAILED 6 != 5 :: (drawntreasure, 2+existing treasures), checking that # of treasures is correct
TEST 357 FAILED 6 != 5 :: (drawntreasure, 2+existing treasures), checking that # of treasures is correct
TEST 358 FAILED 6 != 5 :: (drawntreasure, 2+existing treasures), checking that # of treasures is correct

Another bug surfaced around discarding, and I will not lie, I did not see it 
until I ran his test against mine. The nature of the bug is that the smithy 
card after being played is trashed instead of discarded. This removes the card 
from the game and the deck and ultimately means that the specific instance of 
that card cannot be played again during the game. When a reshuffle occurs, the
card will not be added back into the deck. Checking deck counts after a 
complete game would catch this. 

TEST 7 FAILED 0 != 1 :: checking that playedcards iterated
TEST 8 FAILED 0 != 13 :: checking that smithy is added to discard
TEST 130 FAILED 0 != 1 :: checking that playedcards iterated
TEST 131 FAILED 0 != 13 :: checking that smithy is added to discard
TEST 133 FAILED 0 != 1 :: checking that playedcards iterated
TEST 134 FAILED 0 != 13 :: checking that smithy is added to discard
TEST 252 FAILED 0 != 1 :: checking that playedcards iterated
TEST 253 FAILED 0 != 13 :: checking that smithy is added to discard
TEST 255 FAILED 0 != 1 :: checking that playedcards iterated
TEST 256 FAILED 0 != 13 :: checking that smithy is added to discard

All of these tests were on checking a single turn. Why there are thirteen cards
already in the discard pile after every single run, even after multiple 
re-deals, escapes me. Possibly another bug?
