Title: playAdventurer treasure count off by one 

Class: Serious Game Logic Error

Date:                8/6/17
Reported By:         mouldsm

Product: dominio                Version: (master)
Platform: *nix                  Version: (flip)
Browser: NA                     Version: NA
URL: NA       

Is it reproducible: Yes 

Description
===========
On line 1244 in dominion.c in the playAdventurer function the 
logic allows for an off by one error resulting in one too many treasure cards 
to be put into the hand. The new test cases have adjusted for this.


Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------
Initialize game of dominion with 2 players. 
At any time when the card adventurer can be played and is played the bug will
surface.


Expected Results
----------------
After playing adventurer, the player playing the card should have found 2
treasure cards and put them into their hand. 


Actual Results
--------------
After playing adventurer, the player has 3 more treasure cards in their hand.
This is one more than called for. 


Workarounds
-----------
Currently, this does not have a workaround, and since gameplay is only modified
and this bug does not cause a fatal error no workaround was sought. A fix is
suggested for line 1244 in dominion.c in the playAdventurer function changing
the <= to just < .

Title: playSmithy played as trash instead of into discard   

Class: Serious Play Logic Error

Date:             8/5/17
Reported By:      mouldsm
Email:            mouldsm@oregonstate.edu


Product: dominion               Version: master
Platform: *nix                  Version: (flip)
Browser:  NA                    Version: NA
URL: NA

Is it reproducible: Yes

Description
===========
The nature of the bug is that the smithy card after being played is trashed 
instead of discarded. This removes the card from the game and the deck and 
ultimately means that the specific instance of that card cannot be played 
again during the game. When a reshuffle occurs, the card will not be added 
back into the deck. Checking deck counts after a complete game would catch this 



Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------
Initialize game and create situation where smithy can be played and play smithy. 


Expected Results
----------------
Smithy should gain 3 cards to the player's hand and then be placed in the
discard pile awaiting a reshuffle. 


Actual Results
--------------
Smithy gains 3 cards for the player and then the card is placed in the trash and
cannot be reshuffled into the deck. 


Workarounds
-----------
No workarounds exist. A solution is suggested, requiring that line 1312 in
dominion.c be changed from:
trashFlag = 1; 
--to--
trashFlag = 0;

The trashflag variable when set causes a card to be discarded in the trash
rather than in the discard pile for eventual reuse after a reshuffle.
