BUG REPORT ID :: 0001  (okay - just to demonstrate?)
In file: dominion.c
In function(s): playAdventurer

Descritption:
On line 1244 in dominion.c in the playAdventurer function the 
logic allows for an off by one error resulting in one too many treasure cards 
to be put into the hand. The new test cases have adjusted for this.  An Example
is below.

TEST 239 FAILED 6 != 5 :: (drawntreasure, 2+existing treasures), checking that # of treasures is correct
TEST 240 FAILED 6 != 5 :: (drawntreasure, 2+existing treasures), checking that # of treasures is correct
TEST 357 FAILED 6 != 5 :: (drawntreasure, 2+existing treasures), checking that # of treasures is correct
TEST 358 FAILED 6 != 5 :: (drawntreasure, 2+existing treasures), checking that # of treasures is correct

BUG REPORT ID :: 0002 
In file: dominion.c
In function(s): playSmithy

Description:
The nature of the bug is that the smithy card after being played is trashed 
instead of discarded. This removes the card from the game and the deck and 
ultimately means that the specific instance of that card cannot be played 
again during the game. When a reshuffle occurs, the card will not be added 
back into the deck. Checking deck counts after a complete game would catch this 

On line 1312 in dominion.c the cause of the bug may be the discard flag
"trashFlag" is set when it should not be. This causes discardCard to remove
smithy rather than discard it. 

TEST 7 FAILED 0 != 1 :: checking that playedcards iterated
TEST 8 FAILED 0 != 13 :: checking that smithy is added to discard
TEST 130 FAILED 0 != 1 :: checking that playedcards iterated
TEST 131 FAILED 0 != 13 :: checking that smithy is added to discard
TEST 133 FAILED 0 != 1 :: checking that playedcards iterated
TEST 134 FAILED 0 != 13 :: checking that smithy is added to discard
TEST 252 FAILED 0 != 1 :: checking that playedcards iterated
TEST 253 FAILED 0 != 13 :: checking that smithy is added to discard
TEST 255 FAILED 0 != 1 :: checking that playedcards iterated
TEST 256 FAILED 0 != 13 :: checking that smithy is added to discard

All of these tests were on checking a single turn. Why there are thirteen cards
already in the discard pile after every single run, even after multiple 
re-deals, escapes me. Possibly another bug?
